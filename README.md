# PUBG-win-predictions

PUBG Finish Placement Predictions is a Kaggle competition. The dataset includes features from games (such as assists,boosts,damageDealt,DBNOs,headshotKills ....) and the problem to be solved is to predict the probability of players winning a game. 
The goal is achieved by 1. Removing unnecessary features from the dataset, 2. Feature Scaling, 3. Trying different ML algorithms and determining the best algorithm by MSE which is the Mean Squared Error.
The most successful algorithm is Random Forest with an accuracy of 75% in predicting the probability of players winning a game.
